# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website where I showcase some of my early projects as a beginner developer. It’s still a work in progress — just like me!

## About

This is a custom portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and a pinch of JavaScript. I started from a pre-made template (hence the 10,000+ lines of CSS — don’t ask), and modified it to fit my style. 

Yes, the profile picture is temporary. Yes, it’s funny. No, I’m not changing it yet.

## Features

- Responsive design  
- Project gallery  
- Links to my social media  
- A footer that says “Made with ❤️ and a bit of coffee” because... truth.

## Status

This is a beta version, and more improvements are on the way. I plan to make it cleaner, lighter, and even more personal. For now, feel free to explore and give feedback!

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript
